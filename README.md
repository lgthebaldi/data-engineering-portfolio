# Data Engineering Portfolio 🇧🇷 ➡️ 🇺🇸

This repository documents my journey from Product Engineering Trainee to Software & Data Engineer. It follows a structured roadmap focusing on **Software Engineering Fundamentals**, **Data Structures**, and **DevOps**.

## 📂 Projects

### [Week 1: Financial CLI (Data Validation)](./week_1)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
A Python command-line tool to track personal expenses with strict data quality rules.
* **Tech Stack:** Python 3, Pydantic, JSON.
* **Key Concepts:** Type Hinting, Virtual Environments, Data Persistence.

### [Week 2: Algorithms & Logic](./week_2)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
Evolution of the CLI to include manual data processing engines without external libraries.
* **Tech Stack:** Python 3 (Core).
* **Key Concepts:**
    * **Linear Search ($O(N)$):** Manual filtering mechanism.
    * **Timsort & Lambdas:** Sorting data by custom keys.
    * **Aggregation:** Statistical analysis of data structures.



### [Week 3: Docker & Containerization](./week_3)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
Packaged the application into a Docker Container for absolute reproducibility.
* **Tech Stack:** Docker, Dockerfile.
* **Key Concepts:** Containerization, Image vs. Container, Bind Mounts (Volumes) for persistence.

### [Week 4: SQL & Databases](./week_4)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
Migrated storage to SQLite to improve performance and data integrity.
* **Tech Stack:** Python, SQLite3.
* **Key Concepts:** Relational Schemas, SQL Queries (`SELECT`, `INSERT`), SQL Injection Protection, Performance optimization (`ORDER BY`).

### [Week 5: APIs & FastAPI](./week_5)
**Status:** ✅ Completed
Transformed the logic into a RESTful API service.
* **Tech Stack:** FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLite.
* **Key Concepts:** HTTP Methods (GET/POST), Request/Response Models, Query Parameters, Automatic Documentation (Swagger UI).
